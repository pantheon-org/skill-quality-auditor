# D7: Pattern Recognition (10 points)

**Purpose:** Ensure the skill activates when needed via description keywords and trigger conditions.

**Scoring:**

| Points | Signal |
| ------ | ------ |
| 9–10 | Rich keywords, comprehensive triggers |
| 7–8 | Good keywords, could expand |
| 5–6 | Basic keywords |
| 0–4 | Missing or poor |

## Requirements

- Description must include domain keywords
- Trigger scenarios in the description or a "When to Apply" section
- Example: "Use when writing BDD tests, feature files, Gherkin scenarios…"

The best description = exhaustive trigger list + concrete examples.

## Discriminativeness (diagnostic signal)

A high-quality description reduces false positives by anchoring the skill to specific contexts:

1. **Negative anchor** — explicitly states when NOT to activate
   (e.g., `Does not apply`, `SKIP when`, `Not for`, `Exclude`, `DO NOT trigger`, `not intended for`)

2. **Workflow anchor** — trigger tied to a concrete artifact or action
   (e.g., references `file`, `PR`, `commit`, `test`, `config`, `pipeline`, `migration`)

| Anchors present | Diagnostic |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Both | INFO — positive signal |
| Neither | WARN — may over-trigger on adjacent topics |
| One | No diagnostic |

This is a diagnostic signal only — it does not affect the numeric score in the current iteration.
